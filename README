CSVDB

A test module to access CSV files as if they were database tables.

Open a CSVDB object by supplying the name of a CSV file, and then use select,
insert, update and delete to read and write the CSV.

Use the command line utility csvdb to either look at CSV files interactively,
or do things with them by providing command line arguments.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This is version 0.01 -- so an improvement to this would be to copy the command
line script csvdb to the user's bin directory. To come.
